# Lab Report 3

## Command: `find`

The command I will be further exploring is `find`, which performs multiple operations aimed at finding files and directories through different methods based on command-line options. 

Four useful command-line options for `find` will be explored more in-depth below:


## 1. -path 

Example 1: 

``` 
-bash-4.2$ find biomed -path *51.txt
biomed/gb-2001-2-12-research0051.txt
biomed/gb-2002-3-9-research0051.txt
biomed/gb-2003-4-8-r51.txt
```
